# 📚 Algorithm & Data Structures 🚀

Welcome to the **Algorithm-Data-Structures** repository! This is a collection of Python projects exploring core concepts in **data structures** and **algorithmic problem-solving**. Each project tackles a unique challenge, from **directory traversal** to **memory management simulations**, with a mix of efficiency, creativity, and a bit of personal flair.

## 📌 Projects Overview

### 🎥 **Movie Recommendation & Directory Traversal** (`main.py`)

- Implements **recursive directory traversal** to locate and load **movie data** from text files.
- Uses a **Deque (double-ended queue)** for **movie storage and recommendations**.
- Features a **speakeasy-style UI**, inspired by 1920s slang, for a fun **interactive menu system**.
- Offers:
  - **Movie listing & searching with autocomplete**
  - **Personalized recommendations**
  - **Top-rated movie selections**
- Libraries used: `os`, `pyfiglet`, `colorama`

📌 **Concepts applied**: **Recursion**, **Deque ADT**, **File I/O**, **Error Handling**, **Sorting Algorithms**

### 💧 **Health Tracker** (`health_tracker.py`)

- A simple **daily health logger** to track:
  - 💦 **Water intake** (goal: 64 oz/day)
  - 🏃 **Activity minutes** (goal: 30 min/day)
- **User-friendly CLI menu** for logging data.
- **Encouraging messages** based on progress.
- **Data reset feature** to start fresh every day.
- **Error handling** to prevent invalid inputs.

📌 **Concepts applied**: **User Input Handling**, **Looping Constructs**, **Conditionals**, **Global Variables & Constants**

---

### 📂 **Directory Tree Traversal** (`directory_traverse.py`)

- **Recursive function** to traverse **file directories**.
- **Indentation formatting** for a **tree-like output**.
- **Error handling** for permission and path issues.
- **Latin-inspired variable names** for a touch of creativity.

📌 **Concepts applied**: **Recursion**, **Tree Representation**, **Error Handling**, **Python Generators**

---

### 🔑 **School Locker System (Dynamic Array Simulation)** (`school_locker.py`)

- **Mimics low-level memory management** like **C-based array handling**.
- **Dynamic resizing** for efficient memory allocation.
- Features:
  - **Locker Addition & Insertion**
  - **Locker Removal**
  - **Locker Search**
  - **Dynamic Expansion**
- Uses **ctypes** for raw memory allocation.

📌 **Concepts applied**: **Dynamic Arrays**, **Memory Allocation**, **Custom Data Structures**

## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### 🛠 Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python **3.x** installed. Some projects require:

```bash
pip install pyfiglet colorama
```

### ▶ **Running a Project**

To execute a project, simply run:

```bash
python filename.py
```

For example:

```bash
python main.py
```
